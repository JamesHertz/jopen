# jopen
Handfull script to open linux files from the terminal without halting it (the terminal).<br>
You can easily install it by downloading the file, opening the terminal where you downloaded it, and executing the following command:
```
sudo cp jopen /usr/bin
```
To use it you only have to execute the following
```
jopen file_name0 file_name1 ...
```
Where here each <strong>file_name</strong> can be replaced by the file name you ought to open.<br>
It will open each file using the default program already defined on your machine for such file.

## requisits
You need to have xdg-open installed on your machine :)
